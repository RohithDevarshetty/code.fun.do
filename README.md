Basic idea is to implement an application that tracks the age of citizens up until they are 18 and then automatically creates a voter ID
for that citizen.

The application should register the age of people through a form(Aadhar) and then, when he turns 18, we can know his contact, address through his aadhar ID, we can then send a notification to him regarding registration for voterID.
If already sufficient information to create his VoterID as we have his aadhar card, we will create voterID by default and send it to him, if there isn't sufficient data to cretae , we contact him to provide them through web application.
So as soon a citizen creates an Aadhar card, we can assure that he will get an VoterID.
